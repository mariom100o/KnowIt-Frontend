## Project Overview  
During the UW Saves The World Hackathon, we built **KnowIt**, a Chrome extension that empowers readers to:  
1. **Evaluate article reliability** with a clear score and alternative sources.  
2. **Detect phishing** in Gmail messages before clicking any links.  

This frontend repository contains the popup UI, styling, and Chrome-extension wiring.

## Features  
- **Article Reliability**  
  - Scrapes page content, sends it to a backend evaluator, and displays a reliability percentage.  
  - Offers links to alternative, credible articles.  
- **Gmail Phishing Detection**  
  - Reveals a “Check email for phishing” button only on mail.google.com.  
  - Displays a color-coded score and explanation when phishing is suspected.
